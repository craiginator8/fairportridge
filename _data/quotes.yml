- quote: My lady, Kathy, and I moved into our home in Strawberry Flats over 8 years ago. It was the best move we made in our 50 years of marriage – and it was number 13! Kathy passed last year, but we both loved living here and I have no plans to leave. The quality of our home, the ease of living (no maintenance work for me!), the location, the neighbors, are all big pluses; and with the Mosso’s as our caretakers – life here is good. After living in three other apartment complexes in this area, I speak from experience – Strawberry Flats is the best by far.
